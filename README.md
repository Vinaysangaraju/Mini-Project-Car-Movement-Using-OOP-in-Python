# Car–Vehicle Mini Project (Python OOP)

## 📌 Description
This mini project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python using a real-world Car and Vehicle model. The project shows how inheritance, composition, and method overriding work together to simulate vehicle movement.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Implemented
- **Inheritance** – `Car` class inherits from `Vehicle`
- **Composition** – `Car` has an `Engine` object
- **Polymorphism** – `move()` method is overridden in `Car`
- **Encapsulation** – Data and methods are bundled inside classes
